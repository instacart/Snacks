You can use either `yarn` or `npm` to install Snacks and its dependencies.

### with yarn
```sh
yarn add 'ic-snacks'
```

### with npm
```sh
npm install 'ic-snacks'
```
### Installing peer dependencies
Snacks has a few peer dependencies required to use the library.
> If you already have these libraries listed in your app's dependencies, there's no need to install them again.

For the main component library:
- prop-types v15 or v16
- radium v18+
- React v15 or v16
- ReactDom v15 or v16

If you'd like to use animations: react-transition-group v2.2


#### with yarn
```sh
yarn add radium
yarn add prop-types
yarn add react
yarn add react-dom
yarn add react-transition-group
```

#### with npm
```sh
npm install radium
npm install prop-types
npm install react
npm install react-dom
npm install react-transition-group
```
